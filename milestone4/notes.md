# Plan for Milestone 4

### Using pretrained model
*Option 1*
- use pretrained model to predict paraphrase for (w1, w2) and for (w2, w3)
- use one w/ higher probability
*Option 2*
- use pretrained model to predict paraphrase for (w1w2, w3) and for (w1, w2w3)
- use one w/ higher probability
*Option 3*
- use pretrained model to predict paraphrase for (w1, w3) and for (w2, w3) (like Lauer's paper?)
- use one w/ higher probability
